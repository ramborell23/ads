    <p>Playing against his former team for the first time didn't go exactly as planned for Paul George, except for the winning
        part. While the Oklahoma City Thunder handled business against the Indiana Pacers, 114-96, on Wednesday night, it
        came largely with George saddled with foul trouble throughout the game. It started early, as he picked up a pair
        of quick fouls in the first quarter, with him motioning to Thunder coach Billy Donovan after the second infraction
        to leave him in. George then picked up a third early in the second quarter and was limited to only 12 minutes in
        the first half. He picked up his fourth just two minutes into the third, then his fifth after checking back in with
        two minutes left in the quarter. George then fouled out with 6:15 left in the fourth, with only 10 points on 4 of
        8 shooting in 19 minutes. "That hasn't happened often in my career," George said of winning the game despite his
        struggles. "Fortunate to have those guys carry me. They knew how big this game was for me, and they went out and
        got it for me." "Those guys" being Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony, who combined for 56 points. Westbrook notched
        his second triple-double of the season with 28 points, 10 rebounds and 16 assists, while Anthony added another 28
        on 9 of 17 shooting and 10 rebounds. "It was just Russ and Melo did an unbelievable job of really shouldering everything,"
        George said. "They carried the team, they carried me. It's great to have two guys that comparable that when nights
        aren't going for me, they're there for me." Westbrook controlled the third, scoring 13 in the quarter, while Anthony
        had one of his best all-around games with the Thunder, posting his first double-double and three blocks.

    <p>"I think that's why we all committed to this journey, committed to this team, because of nights like this," Anthony said.
        "Even though one of our big pieces didn't have a great game tonight, there were other guys that were able to step
        up. So we didn't have to rely on him as much as we probably would in other games. That's the beauty of us coming
        together and having a team like this, because on any given night, we're all going to have bad nights, we're all going
        to have off nights, but other guys can step up in place of it." With the foul issues plaguing him, George never found
        anything close to a rhythm, but Donovan walked away "impressed" with the way George handled the frustrating performance.
        "I was actually even more impressed with him tonight, watching him have to go through that," Donovan said. "Just
        his composure, staying in the game, playing the right way, not pressing. I was really impressed with him. I think
        sometimes in adverse situations you get the chance to see different things with people, but I was really, really
        impressed with him tonight." George said earlier in the week it probably would be "emotional" playing against his
        old team, which traded him to the Thunder in late June, after George's agent made it clear he did not plan on re-signing
        with the Pacers next summer. When he walked onto the floor before the contest, he gave a brief wave across the court
        before locking into his routine. He spoke with a few staffers and former teammates at halftime, then talked with
        a number of Indiana coaches and players after the game. "It was great. It was great to see everybody," George said.
        "It was all smiles on my end, from players to training staff to coaches. It was all smiles. It was great seeing those
        guys. I enjoyed my time with them, but people move on, players move on, it is what it. I'm happy where I'm at now."
        Just a week ago, Anthony, formerly of the New York Knicks, went through the same experience, playing against his
        old team in the Thunder's opener. He described it as "closing the chapter," something George said he felt as well
        after playing the Pacers, though it was really done well before the game.

        OKLAHOMA CITY -- Paul George scored just 10 points against his former team, and it was the kind of game he had longed for.
        Russell Westbrook's triple-double picked up the slack and helped the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Indiana Pacers
        114-96 on Wednesday night. The Pacers traded George to Oklahoma City after it became public knowledge that he didn't
        plan on staying with the team long-term. George, a four-time All-Star while he was with the Pacers, savored being
        able to have an off night while his team still won comfortably. Westbrook finished with 28 points, 16 assists and
        10 rebounds and Carmelo Anthony had 28 points and 10 rebounds for the Thunder to take the pressure off George. "That
        hasn't happened often in my career," George said. "Fortunate to have those guys carry me. They know how big this
        game was for me, and they went out and got it for me." George rarely fouls out, but he committed his sixth with 6:15
        remaining after playing just 19 minutes. "It's a coincidence, right?" George said. "I don't know what was the cause.
        It was an agenda tonight." Steven Adams added 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Thunder, who snapped a two-game skid.
        Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis, who were sent from Oklahoma City to Indiana as part of the George deal, both
        started against their former team. Oladipo scored 35 points on 11 for 18 shooting. Oladipo downplayed facing the
        Thunder. "Yeah, just another game, man," Oladipo said. "We have to go out and try to win. Unfortunately we came up
        short." Oladipo increased his scoring average to 26 points per game. He has thrived in coach Nate McMillan's up-tempo
        offense. "Vic's been playing really well for us," said Pacers guard Darren Collison, who scored 18 points. "He has
        a good flow. It's good to have a player like that, that can get it going the way he's been getting it going. Hopefully
        we get some wins with that and make us productive." The Thunder led 54-48 at halftime behind 15 points from Anthony
        and 11 points and 10 assists from Westbrook. Oladipo scored 21 points before the break. Oklahoma City got it going
        early in the second half. A 3-pointer by Josh Huestis put the Thunder ahead 70-57. A driving layup by Westbrook expanded
        the lead to 82-66 with about three minutes left in the period. Westbrook had eight rebounds when he sat down to rest
        late in the third. He returned in the fourth period and grabbed his 10th rebound with just under five minutes remaining.
        "He was great tonight," Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. "Overall, I felt like he surveyed and managed the game
        and the floor, moving guys around. He did an exceptional job." TIP-INS Pacers: The Oklahoma City crowd greeted Oladipo
        and Sabonis warmly during pregame introductions. ... Sabonis got his fourth straight start at center in place of
        Myles Turner, who was out again with a concussion and a sore neck. Sabonis finished with four points. ... Indiana
        was coming off a 130-107 win at Minnesota on Tuesday night. ... McMillan was issued a technical foul early in the
        fourth period.
